# Introduction

Interaction on the web comes in two forms (excuse the pun):

1. Passive interaction i.e. reading

2. Active interaction (filling in information).

Forms enable #2 and when you're asking a user to do something interactive, it's super important to get this right. There are many aspects of *right* - this book aims to answer them all.

People use forms to search for content, to log-in, and to purchase products etc. Due to this, forms are probably one of the most, if not *the* most important interactions on the web.

Forms can be a lovely experience and they can be a horrible experience. Forms can be fun to build and they can be horrible to build. This book provides everything you need to provide a lovely experience and a lovely technical solution.
