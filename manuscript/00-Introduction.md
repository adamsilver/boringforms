# Introduction

People use forms to search for content, to log-in, and to purchase products etc. Due to this, forms are probably one of the most, if not *the* most important interactions on the web.

Forms can be a lovely experience and they can be a horrible experience. Forms can be fun to build and they can be horrible to build. This book provides everything you need to provide a lovely experience and a lovely technical solution.

## Mess

* Passive interaction (reading), active interaction (filling in information)

* Don't make buttons look like links, cursor: pointer

* Multiple submit buttons: Don't but what if I have to?

* Misusing forms using select for navigation

* Trying to tame their styles

* Multiple select forms list of products (checkboxes for multi-select, buttons for individual, big buttons for multi add etc)

* Where .NET has got it wrong for checkboxes on vs true

* Form Validation

* Native & mobile form behaviour

* Multi page forms, wizards, dependent form controls

* Enhancement, scripting and validation

* Don't use click, instead of 'submit' event for primary action

* More than one action...Split out into separate wizard like form, decide primary action.

* Contextual submit click

* Don't make something look like a form element when it is not (affordance). Like Biscevic using radios for delivery
