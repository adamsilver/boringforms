# Introduction

Interaction on the web comes in two forms: passive interaction i.e. reading, active interaction (filling in information). Forms allow for the latter and are obviously much more involved.

People use forms to search for content, to log-in, and to purchase products etc. Due to this, forms are probably one of the most, if not *the* most important interactions on the web.

Forms can be a lovely experience and they can be a horrible experience. Forms can be fun to build and they can be horrible to build. This book provides everything you need to provide a lovely experience and a lovely technical solution.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for both for designers and developers, both back-end and front-end of pretty much any ability.
