# Buttons

1. Buttons, input type image

2. Buttons shouldnt have cursor: pointer

3. Don't make something look like a form element when it is not (affordance). Like Biscevic using radios for delivery

You must provide a submit button for everyform. No exceptions. This is expected, intuitive and required to work in all browsers without issue. It's standard and good practice.

This HTML allows you to place any primary (and secondary) call to actions. Typically this is placed at the end of the form.

	<input type="submit" value="Checkout" name="checkout">
