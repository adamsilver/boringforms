# Designing forms

## Overview:

99 percent of the time you will want the design of the form to be as follows:

1. Standard fields to have labels above controls.

2. Groups of checkboxes or radios to have a fieldset and legend (sometimes hidden) with labels to the *right* of each control.

3. A primary button at the bottom of the form.

4. Linear, single column so that the eye goes down

5. If you must have optional fields, then mark them with an asterisk and denote it at the top of the form.

6. Don't try and customise the visual design of form controls, let other parts of the site cater to branding requirements. You're asking for trouble if you try and tame the look and feel cross-browser.

7. Form submit buttons should not have a pointer cursor like links. They are not links. The hand does *not* denote "clickable" contrary to popular misguided belief.

* Design - field length

* Design - labels top

* Design - avoid multi select menu

* Design - radios vs select

* Design - optional fields - scrap em, or asterix or?
