# Miscellaneous

* Don't use click, instead of 'submit' event for primary action

* More than one action...Split out into separate wizard like form, decide primary action.

* Contextual submit click

* Don't make something look like a form element when it is not (affordance). Like Biscevic using radios for delivery

* Where .NET has got it wrong for checkboxes on vs true

* Misusing forms using select for navigation

* Don't make buttons look like links, cursor: pointer

* Multiple submit buttons: Don't but what if I have to?

* Trying to tame their styles

* Multiple select forms list of products (checkboxes for multi-select, buttons for individual, big buttons for multi add etc)

* Native & mobile form behaviour

* Multi page forms, wizards, dependent form controls

* Success messages? Post/Redirect/Get

* Buttons, input type image

* Allow people to select exactly one choice from two or more always visible and mutually exclusive options. Because radio buttons are mutually exclusive, they should have a default value selected (more on this later). Itâ€™s also a good idea to make sure both the radio button and its label can be selected to activate a radio button selection.

* Design - field length

* Design - labels top

* Design - avoid multi select menu

* Design - radios vs lists

* Design - optional fields - scrap em, or asterix or?
