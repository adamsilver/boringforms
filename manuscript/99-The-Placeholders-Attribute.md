Why placeholders in form fields are not replacements for labels Since the placeholder got released, designers and developers alike have been quick to jump on them as a replacement for labels in the name of having a cleaner UI — which is a common UX fallacy. 

Ditching labels for placeholders might seem like an ‘innovative’ thing to do but it is fraught with problems. Before looking at those, let’s take a really quick look at what the placeholder can do for people trying to fill out forms.

What’s a placeholder? The placeholder attribute used on form controls, represents a short hint (a word or phrase) intended to aid the user with inputting data. A hint could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format etc.

Okay, so what are these problems?

1. Browser support
Plenty of browsers do support the placeholder attribute. But plenty do not. 

If you don’t use labels, then the user is going to see an empty form field with no idea as to what they are meant to put in it. This should be reason enough not to rely on the placeholder because forms are a burden for the user so making them super friendly is in your best interest.

2. Disappearing placeholder text strains users’ short-term memory Because the placeholder disappears as the user starts typing, the user can easily forget the hint, particularly on longer forms or more complex form fields. 

They might have to click away from the field (depending on the browser) or undo what they typed just to see the hint again. Not good.

In an ideal world, your users would completely focused on filling out your form without any distraction or short term memory loss. But in reality this isn’t true. Why make your users work for this?

You might say that on a simple login form that it’s okay to omit the labels as everyone knows what to type on these familiar forms but firstly why make it harder? And secondly the labels might represent a username OR email and the password placeholder might provide a hint to help the user type their password — if it’s not ever present it’s unnecessary effort.

3. Edit forms where the value is already supplied This means when the user views the page, they have no idea what these values represent. They will have to remove the value temporarily just to see what it pertains to. A terrible experience.

4. Without labels, reviewing the entries is impossible Much like #3, if a user wants to review what they entered, they won’t understand what they entered relates to so they don’t know if it’s correct or not. Some browsers actually will autocomplete incorrectly which makes this even worse.

Again, you’re left with hoping the user deletes each entry one by one just to check the placeholder hint. In reality people just won’t do this — they are already drained from having to fill the form in without labels.

5. Error messages become difficult to address Just like #3 and #4 if you don’t have labels then there is no frame of reference for what the error means. The only course of action is delete each value again or to give up. Hope for the former, expect the latter.

6. Some browsers will delete the placeholder text when the user enters the field Most browsers, fortunately don’t do this, but for those that do, this becomes painful. A lot of users will tab into the next field. When they do there will be no time to even glimpse at the placeholder hint. This is only marginally better than problem #1.

7. Placeholder text might appear to be default values People might even think that placeholder text is a real value which means the user ends up skipping entry and will be prompted to go back and fill it out if required unnecessarily.

8. Fields that contain data already seem complete If you’re scanning a more complex form, you’re going to try and spot the empty fields. Placeholders make everything seem filled out already.

9. Placeholder copy is often ‘greyed’ out Placeholder copy is afforded by being ‘greyed out’. First, it’s quite subtle que and second it suffers from poor contrast, so people with less than perfect vision will struggle, again causing drain. 

Not all browsers allow you to override the colour, but in some ways you wouldn’t want to because you will lose the affordance.

What should you do? It’s simple really — use labels. They work in every browser. They are easy to reference being in close proximity to the field. They won’t disappear and disorientate the user. Always there to help.

Now you can use a placeholder in addition to a label but even then some of the aforementioned issues might still apply. The best thing to do is to put any additional hints with the label copy.

All of the above problems drain the users energy and stop them completing their task. A great experience helps the user. So help the user.
