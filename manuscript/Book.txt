# Always use a label
[done]

# Avoid placeholders and what to do instead
- when the user needs extra help, hint or instructions. Placeholder with the label etc.
[done]

# Grouping fields with a fieldset

# Asking for information.
- Do you really need to ask for it - Jared 300 Button
- How do you mark the field as required or optional
- Optionally explain why you're asking for that information

# Have a single action and button per form

# How to position labels
- To the right for checkboxes and radios
- Above for all others

# Select boxes
- Use as last resort
- Avoid multi-select
- Don't misuse select box i.e. onchange

# Provide feedback on submit (don't hold their hand too early)

# Error handling
- Don't provide it too early. On submit is good.
- Show messages as a group at the top
- Show message in context of the form too
- How to visually make this clear

15. Though shall not make buttons act like links (and links should not submit forms)

16. Though shall not to try to customise the look and feel too much

17. Though shall consider affordance in terms of size of control i.e. postcode

18. Though shall use AJAX for form submission with extreme caution

21. Though shall use 1 field instead of 3 i.e. the date field

22. Though shall give the user a sense of positive affirmation. Checkout progress bar, success messages. Tick is only as good as the client side checks unless using ajax which is ill-advised.

23. Though shall display success messages until the user decides to hide it. No automatic dismisally of success messages.

24. Though shall make forms human and conversational. Don't use jargon.

25. Though shall only reveal a form when one is asked for. Progressive disclosure.

26. Though shall split up long forms depending on context.

27. Though shall use sensible defaults i.e. radios - free delivery checkout

33. Though shall not use unfriendly defaults. Anti pattern. "Uncheck the box if you don't wish to get email"

28. Though shall avoid duplication like - confirm password. Just show password.

29. Though shall always design a form based on context, not on reuse. Kidly onboarding expecting vs has kids.

30. Though shall ask for information in a sensible human order.

31. Though shall make label text extra clear. Password vs "Current password" or "New password".

32. Though shall allow for as much mistakes or flexibility as possible. Spaces, uppercase etc.

34. Though shall put form elements in a single column. Tabbing etc is better.

35. Though shall ensure captchas are user-friendly to everyone Christopherson

36. Though shall indicate max-length but not stop entry.

37. Thought shall not use asterisk for marking required fields, mark optional fields (Mr Joe)

38. Though shall not use sliders unless they really have to (maybe a colour picker) (Mr Joe)
