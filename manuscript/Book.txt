	8. Though shall avoid multiple select controls

	9. Though shall use select boxes as a last resort

	10. Though shall not misuse the select box

	11. Though shall not hold the hands of users too early

	18. Though shall use AJAX for form submission with extreme caution

	19. Though shall explain why the user should fill in the form

	20. Though shall reveal help text at the right time in the right way. Not too much either.

	21. Though shall use 1 field instead of 3 i.e. the date field

	22. Though shall give the user a sense of positive affirmation. Checkout progress bar, success messages. Tick is only as good as the client side checks unless using ajax which is ill-advised.

	23. Though shall display success messages until the user decides to hide it. No automatic dismisally of success messages.

	24. Though shall make forms human and conversational. Don't use jargon.

	32. Though shall allow for as much mistakes or flexibility as possible. Spaces, uppercase etc.

	33. Though shall not use unfriendly defaults. Anti pattern. "Uncheck the box if you don't wish to get email"

	34. Though shall put form elements in a single column. Tabbing etc is better.

	35. Though shall ensure captchas are user-friendly to everyone Christopherson

	36. Though shall indicate max-length but not stop entry.
	
	37. Thought shall not use asterisk for marking required fields, mark optional fields (Mr Joe Boring forms)
	
	38. Though shall not use sliders unless they really have to (maybe a colour picker) (Mr Joe again)
