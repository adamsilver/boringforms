# Radio vs select

1. Allow people to select exactly one choice from two or more always visible and mutually exclusive options. Because radio buttons are mutually exclusive, they should have a default value selected (more on this later). Itâ€™s also a good idea to make sure both the radio button and its label can be selected to activate a radio button selection.
