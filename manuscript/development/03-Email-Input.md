Did you notice it this time? No? Look at the keyboard again. That’s right, the keyboard is different. There are dedicated keys for the @ and . characters to help you complete the field more efficiently. As we discussed with type="search", there is no downside to using type="email" right now. If a browser doesn’t support it, it will degrade to type="text". And in some browsers, users will get a helping hand.
