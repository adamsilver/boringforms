The width of a field should provide a clue to the length of content it requires. The length of the content provides a clue to the type of content. Both of which help the user fill in a form field. 

For example, a postcode is made up of about 8 characters including an optional space. This field should be smaller than other fields in an address form.

If the width of the postcode field is larger to match the other fields, then there's a cognitive burden on the user. They may have to double check the label for example.
